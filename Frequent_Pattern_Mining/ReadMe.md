Experiments here are going to review those basic/popular frequent mining algorithms and also to explore new and better algorithms

*************************************************************

CONCEPTS & TERMINOLOGY

* Frequent Pattern Mining is an unsupervised learning
* <b>Support</b> - probability of an event to occur. For example, `Support(ice-cream)` = number of transactions that contain ice-crea/totoal number of transactions
