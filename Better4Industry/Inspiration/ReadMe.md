### Increasing Fairness Without Reducing Accuracy
* [The paper][1]
* It suggests to increase data sample to increase fiarness, without reducing accuracy. Although in the paper, it didn't use the most straightforward words to explain how did they add these data samples, sounds like just add more data. I think this is similar to proving "1+1=2"
* It also suggests to use clustering to further identify features that can help differentiate difference classes and reduce the discrimioation between same classes. Although there is no straightforward description about how to do this either.
  * <b>This is something I need to gain more experience in practice</b>
