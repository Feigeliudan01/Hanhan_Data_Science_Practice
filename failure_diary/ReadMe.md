<b> Failure Diary </b>, as you can see here

*********************************************************************************
<b>PREFACE</b>

This folder is called "Failure Diary" instead of "Failure Notes" is because, I don't plan to record what I have learned from the failures here :) Many people believe in "Never Give up", I really cannot agree with them all the time. In this Failure Diary, I am recodring all the failed code, and when I am writing them down, it makes me feel much better since I have spent so much time on these code, but didn't work out, if simply put them on my machine or throw them away, I will feel my time got wasted more. Ah! Back to my reason, why I don't agree with "Never Give up" all the time. Well, I think if I have worked very hard during the weekdays and many leisure time when I spent on my side projects, other time should be used to find a balance in life. I need some time to enjoy other things I love, such as reading, food, sleeping, and do nothing. If these time has been forced to domsomething I am not interested in, failures are much more likely to happen, and I even won't explore too much about the failure reasons.

<b>Vancouver Hackathon</b>, holy sh*t

* Background
  * Alice asked me to attend a Vancouver Hackathon with her this weekend. School paid the money for her and also for me, so I had to go, but from the very beginning, I am not interested in this event at all. It is majorly organized by mining companies to find talents to solve their real world problems, so that they can pay some prize without really hiring them. I don't like mining companies at all. Their Hackathon challengs are all about trucks and rocks, which made me lose more interest.... 
  * And it started from Friday after work till Sunday night. These 3 weeks, I worked day and night on weekdays for a deadline, which made me feel exhausted. Weekends are the best time for me to get rid of all those things and have a full control of my life. But this weekend, again, I had to be controled by others, it's quite unpleasant
  * Still, I worked hard. We talked to mentors to learn those mining basic knowledge. Discussed all the data in multiple tables and made the plan in our prototype as well as data science coding parts.
  * To my surprise, their data dictionary has so much problem, and took me almost 2 days to do data cleaning and preprocessing. What made me feel worse was, the more I tried, the lower accuracy I got. What's more, when your teammate just behaves like many other PhDs, if you have experience in data science industry world, do you agree that, what they said & what they thought they could do is there, you also think that's doable within the time limit, but what they could really do is in another place. So finally, you have realized, my godness, the data analysis work will occupy you almost all the time, and you were planning to do the major prototype work, but if your teammate just can not finish the other part, without super power, you really cannot finish all those things alone. Finally, finally, thinking about today's weather is good, thinking about I need to do some house work and want to have my own home-cooking, thinking about no matter how hard I am working, that presentation will make me feel worse for my weekend. So, I gave up. Retured back home, tried more experiments the whole afternoon and got worse and worse results, I decided to put the saved code here (forgot to save the rest of code...).
