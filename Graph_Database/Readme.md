##### Cypher
* Introduction: https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/
* Notes
  * When using `MATCH` to do the search query, you need to specify the starting point. If the property of the label has an index, it will be faster to do the search, especially in a large database.
  * Pattern Nodes - to restrict the pattern when there are multiple records
    * It's a node, doesn't need `where`, although serves like `where`
    * eg. `(newcastle)<-[:STREET|CITY*1..2]-theater`, it means from theater node there can be no more than 2 street-city relations go out to newcastle node, because in the database there can be mutliple theaters have the same name and located in different cities, this constraints is trying to locate the threater in Newcastle
      * The concept here has something similar to cardinality, and it can be difficult to understand at the very beginning...even though the book said with graph DB you don't need to worry about cardinality as relational DB...
  * Anonymous Nodes - the node doesn't specify label and property
    * You use `()` as a node in match when you don't care any detail about the node.
    * If you want to return the values of anonymous nodes, you can have node name in it, such as `(product)` to return the "products" of your search
  * Using `with` will chain returned results together
    * Using `collect()` in return clause, the results will be displaed as a list in 1 row, delimited by comma
