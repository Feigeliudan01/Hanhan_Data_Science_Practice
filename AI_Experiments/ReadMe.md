Time to try experiments in Neural Network, Deep Learning and any other AI methods :)

* Digits recognition with <b>TensorFlow</b> [lower level library]: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/10/an-introduction-to-implementing-neural-networks-using-tensorflow/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29

* Digits recognition, using NN with <b>Keras</b> [higher level library]: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/10/tutorial-optimizing-neural-networks-using-keras-with-image-recognition-case-study/
  * Keras has 3 backend you can use: https://keras.io/backend/
    * Tensorflow (from Google)
    * CNTK (from Microsoft)
    * Theano (from University of Montreal)
    * You can change between these backend
  * Install Keras: https://keras.io/#installation
  * For installing TensorFlow, strongly recommend to use `virtualenv` (it's fast, simply and won't influence other installed python libraries): https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac
  * After `virtualenv` installation and validaton, Commands to turn on and turn off virtual environment:
    * To activate the virtual environment, `$ source ~/Documents/Virtual_Env/bin/activate      # If using bash, sh, ksh, or zsh`, change "Documents/Virtual_Env" to your own virtual environment folder name
    * To activate the virtual environment, `$ source ~/Documents/Virtual_Env/bin/activate.csh  # If using csh or tcsh`, change "Documents/Virtual_Env" to your own virtual environment folder name
    * Then in your terminal, you will see `(Virtual_Env)$`
    * To deactivate your virtual envvironment, `(Virtual_Env)$ deactivate`
  * Install Jupyter Notebook in your virtual environment
    * `(Virtual_Env)$ pip install jupyter`, install jupyter within the active virtualenv
    * `(Virtual_Env)$ pip install ipykernel`, install reference ipykernel package
    * `(Virtual_Env)$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name testenv --display-name "Python2 (Virtual_Env)"`, set up the kernel
    * `(Virtual_Env)$ jupyter notebook`
    * After jupyter notebook has been turned on, when you are creating a new notebook, choose "Python 2 (Virtual_Env)"
    
* Image recognition with Keras: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/architecture-of-convolutional-neural-networks-simplified-demystified/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29
    
* Use pre-trained model for digits recognition: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/transfer-learning-the-art-of-fine-tuning-a-pre-trained-model/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29

* NN Implementation
  * Implement in Python and R: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-and-r/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29
  * My NN code in python: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation/blob/master/neural_network.py
  * My NN code in real time short context search: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_NLP/blob/master/short_context_search.py
