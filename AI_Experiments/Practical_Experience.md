Here, I am taking notes about lessons I have learned that may improve model performance drmatically
As for whether I have to use these methods, depends on the real problems


***************************************************************

DATA EXPLORATION & DATA PREPROCESSING

* BEFORE checking variance of all the features: <b>Normalize</b> these features, deal with outliers, sometimes may also need to deal with special values such as 0

* Outliers: Sometimes, when using IQR to define outliers may include too much data as outliers. Better to check based on real world situation
